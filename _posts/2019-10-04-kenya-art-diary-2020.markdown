“African Honey Bee” is David Roberts’ second painting to be featured in the Kenya Arts Diary. 

First published in 2011, this annual exhibition and physical portable space - in the form of an A5 diary - allows local artists to display their craft. 

“African Honey Bee” comes from the artist’s latest collection, inspired by the insect and animal kingdom. The new collection, “The Small Five” is a homage to the busy underworld of Africa’s lakes, plains and skies, those largely neglected by the Big Game safaris. Featuring the Dragonfly, Dung Beetle, Tortoise, Genet Cat and African Honey Bee (renowned for their superior productivity), this new series offers a snapshot in time of Kenya’s unusual creatures.
