“Reflections” is the perfect vehicle to display David's latest collection, which captures the essence and spirit of Kenya’s enormous equatorial skies, reflective waters and distant mountains. 

His unique mixed media method recreates the depth and luminosity experienced in-situ, from where all his initial drawings originate. Shimmering waters and natural light radiate through the paintings multiple layers.
