> “Indigo has often been considered a mystical colour. And one of its mysteries today is that it is part of a spectrum - one of seven official colours, and yet the one that doesn't quite belong...But if you look at a rainbow it is hard to find a stripe of midnight in the place where blue fades to violet.  Indeed, some people argue that it isn't there at all”.  From 'Colour - Travels through the paintbox' by Victoria Finlay

“The Gentle Drop” of a wild hibiscus flower and “Gathering Storm” of the panoramic skies over Lake Baringo are both featured in “Blue”, an exhibit of ten artists who utilise this much loved and debated colour in their work. 

The work was referenced in an article in [The East African](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/Blue-art-exhibition-One-Off-Gallery-Nairobi/434746-4211198-157eljo/index.html){:target='_blank'}
