David Roberts spent 2008 studying Printmaking at the Florence School of Fine Arts.

“Journey through a lens” explores the architectural order of the city and its relationship to the natural environment.

Using a pinhole camera made from a matchbox, images of fused light and atmosphere influenced this collection of mixed media mono and relief prints.

Multiple collagraph and mono prints of the urban outskirts are layered on top different types of rice and printmaking paper to form the views from the Fiesole hills overlooking the city. 

These mixed media prints incorporate a variety of printing and painting techniques to explore a personal portrayal of the ever changing landscapes and forms of Florence.
