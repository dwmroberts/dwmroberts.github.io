David Roberts’ new exhibition coincides with his return home to Kenya. 

Showcasing his new technique for the first time in Kenya, Polka Dot Gallery offers an experiential taste of the studio with a time lapse projection of the artists’ full process. 

A series of rooms display the original pressed fauna, plus sketches, prints and an insight into the myriad layers of rice and tissue paper, ink and acrylic paints, which build the works. 

Indigenous flowers are examined in microscopic detail, their veins and stamen reproduced in a botanists dream of the patterns and flow of nature.
