David Roberts spent 2011 studying at the Pratt Fine Arts Centre in Seattle.

“Traditions” exhibits works that make use of cultural links and aesthetic traditions as substance for what is contemporary.

“The Other Side” explored methods of layered painting which mimic the effects of printmaking, a unique and new technique has been created which merges print techniques with painting - utilising a mixed media approach.
